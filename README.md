Fixed Layout issues by toggling the desktop version of the website to device view( Mobile first model) by adding some media-querries for mobile and tablet whereby: For extra large devices (no media queries); For desktop/large devices (max-width: 992px); For tablet / medium styles (max-width: 767px); For mobile styles (max-width: 480px) by putting the media querries at the end of each section to facilitate the reading but for performance reasons, the best practice is to unify all the similar breakpoints at the end of the CSS file. In the website syles.css file: inside the /_Helpers section target all images inside the main section by setting the property height to auto and width to 100% and then inside the /_ Section Latest news section, add a new media query (max-width: 767px) Target the row inside section-latest-news and the Property: flex-direction, Value: column. After that move inside the /\* Grid section, at the end, add a new media query (max-width: 767px);First, redefine the variable section-padding and give that value: 5rem 1.5rem. And redefine the variable section-body-padding with 2rem 0 0; then Target the ul.row and the row class. Property: flex-direction, Value: column. Property: margin, Value: 0. Target all the classes that started with col-Property: margin, Value: 0 0 3rem 0. Target the col-1-3 and col-1-2 classes. Property: width, Value: 100%.
